## RULES: One Scene competition

Rules from [Assebly webpage:](https://www.assembly.org/summer19/demoscene/rules)

> "In filmmaking and video production, a scene is generally thought of as the action in a single location and continuous time" (Wikipedia). 

So the idea in this compo is to make a demo that has only a single scene, i.e. similar to cracktros or shadertoy.com shaders.

If you are completely new to demo coding, or donâ€™t have the time to make a full-fledged demo, then this compo is for you. You may also register to the demo coding workshop at the Scene Lounge to get your demo coding career and compo entry kick-started! :)

LENGTH: Demo may not last longer than 1 minute. Organizers may choose to stop the production before the end.

PLATFORM: Entry must run on a Desktop platform.

The user has to be able to exit at any time by pressing a key. On PC this key must be ESC

SIZE: There is no size limit, as long as you can deliver it to us by uploading it through the party system.
